## 2024-12-25 - Hardcoded JWT Secret Key
**Vulnerability:** The JWT signing key was hardcoded as `"masaisecretkey"` in `Authentication/src/controllers/auth.controller.js` and `Authentication/src/middlewares/authenticate.js`.
**Learning:** Hardcoded secrets in source code allow anyone with access to the repo (even read-only) to forge authentication tokens and impersonate any user.
**Prevention:** Always use environment variables for secrets. Implement a startup check to fail fast if required secrets are missing from the environment.
